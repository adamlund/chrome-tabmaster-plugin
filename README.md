# Tab Stacks Chrome Extension

## View and search from a list of open tabs

Tab Stacks is a vertical tab menu that helps you find that tab you have open but can't find in the sea of windows and tabs.

Tab Stacks is for you, the multitasker, who has a lot of open tabs and doesn't want to spend time wading through windows to find that ONE tab. You just need an easy way to navigate them by keyword as quickly as possible.

### Features
